        <p>Hello! My name is Melina Ferner, and I am a senior Computer Engineering and Computer Science double major at
            Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. This site showcases some of my accomplishments as a student at
            Rose-Hulman.</p>
        <p>My story isn't like most of my peers. I selected my computer engineering major on a whim. As I completed high school, I had no idea what job I
            wanted to have, beyond knowing that any fulfilling career path I went down would have to be in STEM. So, as
            a freshman in college, I was a computer engineering major because I thought it would be a fun place to start
            and one of the easier fields to leave if I decided to switch majors. But, by the time I had taken my first
            digital logic course, I knew I was hooked. I grew further enamored as I learned about recursion and data
            structures in my programming courses. I fell in love with sifting through documentation in my first embedded
            systems class, spending hours reading everything I could about the microcontroller I was using so that I
            understood exactly what I could do with it. And by the time I took my first computer architecture course,
            there wasnâ€™t a single doubt in my mind that I had somehow ended up exactly where I belong.</p>
